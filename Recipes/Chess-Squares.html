<h1> How to make Southern Chess Squares</h1>
<p>
    Southern Chess Squares consist of two simple layers. A cake mix crust with chopped pecans topped with a buttery cream cheese layer combine to make one scrumptious bar. Together they are fabulously sweet. If you do not have an extreme sweet tooth, they may not be for you. And because they are so sweet, they are best cut into little squares.

<ul>
    <li>
        In a large bowl mix together a box of yellow cake mix ( I use Betty Crocker or Duncan Hines), a cup of unsalted butter that has been melted and 1 egg. Mix in 1 cup of chopped pecans and press the mixture into the bottom of a 9×13-inch pan lined with parchment paper.

        Next use an electric mixer to beat 2 8-ounce blocks of softened cream cheese together with a 1-pound box of powdered sugar. It’s easiest if you beat the cream cheese by itself briefly and then mix in the powdered sugar in 3 or 4 additions.

        Once smooth, beat in 2 eggs and pour the mixture over the crust. Bake for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees. Let cool before slicing. 
    </li>
</ul>

    Leftovers should be stored in the refrigerator and they taste great cold or at room temperature.
