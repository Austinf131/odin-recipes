<p>
    Ramen is one of my favorite comfort foods, especially when the temperatures drop! It’s important to note that this is NOT the ramen that I’m sure we’ve all had at some point in life, college days maybe? The days before a paycheck when you realize you only have a couple dollars to your name. I’m sure we’ve all had similar experiences.

    <li>
        Sliced Mushrooms: Regular brown mushrooms work great here! You can also use shiitake mushrooms.

        Minced Garlic: Makes the broth nice and savory!

        Ginger Paste: A classic ingredient in Asian cuisine. This adds zip to the flavor of the broth.

        Chicken Stock: Chicken broth is typically what I have on hand and great for a savory soup base. If you want your ramen to have more of the classic Tonkotsu flavor, use pork broth instead. You can also use vegetable broth as a vegetarian/vegan alternative.

        Water: Adjusts the consistency of the ramen soup.

        Soy Sauce: Add a splash for savory flavor!

            Baby Bokchoy: I love adding greens to ramen. These can be chopped or left whole. You can also use spinach!

        <li>
            Instant Ramen Noodles: You only want the uncooked noodles. Throw out those seasoning packets! You can also use fresh ramen noodles if you can find them.
